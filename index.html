        <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
        <p>My name is Daniel Torres, I'm a second year student at IIT majoring in ITM.</p>
        <p>I've been dabbling with web development and a little bit of programming since 2020 during quarantine.</p>
        <p>I took a basic web dev class during my senior year of high school and also tried full stack development using (Debian) Linux, NGINX, myPHPAdmin, and PHP.</p>
        <p>I used that stack to attempt to make a social media website sort've like Facebook and then over the summer I tried making a Discord Clone with Firebase.</p>
        <p>I'm still unsure of what exactly I'll do in the tech space but my current lead is somewhere with content creation and web development.</p>
